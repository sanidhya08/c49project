                        Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.

                        <br>
                        Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.

                        The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.
